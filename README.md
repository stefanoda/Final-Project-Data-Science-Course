# Project Overview

The fictional company, Lumiora, specializes in selling cameras and camera equipment. The company conducted a survey to gather feedback from customers about their demographics, product preferences, and user behavior. This data was collected using a Streamlit-based newsletter, with responses saved into an Excel file. The data was then analyzed using Tableau to generate several dashboards that visualize key insights. These insights will help shape the company's future marketing strategies and campaigns.

## Objectives

Collect customer feedback through a survey sent in a newsletter (built using Streamlit).
Analyze the survey data to uncover customer preferences, behaviors, and trends.
Visualize the results using Tableau dashboards to provide actionable insights.
Guide marketing efforts with data-driven insights to improve customer targeting and engagement.

## Project Components

### Streamlit Newsletter Survey:

A simple interactive survey was created using Streamlit, which was sent out to customers via a newsletter.
Customers responded to questions about their shopping preferences, product satisfaction, and purchasing behavior.
The responses were saved in an Excel file for further analysis.

### Data Collection:

The survey responses were saved in an Excel sheet, which contains information such as:
Demographics (age, gender, location)
Product preferences (brands, cameras, lenses)
User behaviour (main fields of photography, experience)
Brand development (gain and loss of users, usage in different fields)
Customer satisfaction levels


### Tableau Dashboards:

The data collected was imported into Tableau for detailed analysis and visualization.
Several dashboards were created to present different aspects of the customer, such as:
Customer Demographics Breakdown
Product Preferences and Popularity
Gender related choices
Experience and age related choices
Customer Satisfaction

A Tableau Story was built to provide a cohesive narrative of the findings from the dashboards, allowing for easy interpretation of insights.

### Key Insights

Some of the major insights derived from the data analysis include:

Demographics: A significant portion of customers belong to the 25-40 age group, with a nearly even gender distribution.
Geographic Trends: The majority of customers are from North America.
Product Preferences: Sony is the most popular brand among our customers.
Preferencecs by Experience: Full-Frame and Medium Format cameras are mainly used by professionals.
Brands: Sony and Fuji gained popularity while Canon and Nikon lost customers.
Satisfaction Levels: A general high customer satisfaction.
Conclusion: We should collect more Data for specific regions to further learn about our customers needs.


### Tools and Technologies Used:

Python/Streamlit: To build the interactive newsletter survey.

Excel: For data storage and initial handling.

Tableau: To create interactive dashboards and visualizations that present the insights from the data.
